# Fraud-Detection-in-Health-Care-Claims

The healthcare sector is a complex system with many moving parts. It's growing at an rapid speed. Work in the healthcare sector is demanding. The goal of the health sector is to effectively serve as many patients as feasible. However, there are costs involved with each course of treatment with each service rendered.


Fraud in the healthcare industry has significantly increased losses for people, organizations, and governments. Fighting healthcare fraud has proven to be an important issue. As a result, numerous academics have created techniques for detecting healthcare fraud. Finding, identifying, and reporting frauds as they occur within the system is the responsibility of fraud detection systems.


Our goal is to create a system that can identify trends, abnormalities, and possible cases of healthcare fraud in claims information. By improving the general correctness and effectiveness of claims processing, this strategy strives to guarantee prompt payment for acceptable services.

In order to accomplish the goal, four machine learning models with 10+ features were created.Each component of these models was methodically and precisely analyzed. We examined the corresponding significance of each of these models' performance metrics scores. 

The Random Forest algorithm outperforms other models in terms of precision and recall when it comes to predicting both 0 and 1. Thus, the model is able to predict true positive values of 0 and 1 with efficiency. The model has the highest cumulative F1-score as a result.
